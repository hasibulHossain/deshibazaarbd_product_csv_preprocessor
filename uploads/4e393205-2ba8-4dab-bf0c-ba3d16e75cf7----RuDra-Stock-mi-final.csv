Introducing the SmartMi KN95 free-breathing anti haze face mask. In the current climate for many people having a face covering of some form will bring a degree of reassurance. The SmartMi KN95 face mask is in itself a very special anti-pollution mask that also gives off an element of style. 
It is reusable and designed for comfortable long term wear. We suggest wearing for no longer than 10 hours in a single-use. You will find the longer you wear the SmartMi KN95 face mask the more comfortable it becomes. 
This is because of the special TPU memory elastic material which is integrated with sponge foam. After a short time of wearing the mask becomes adaptive to your natural facial contours. 
One of the downfalls of typical face masks is that they can severely impact normal breathing. This is due to the limited space within and external pressure on the outside of the mask. The Smart Mi KN95 features a specially designed 3D skeletal structure which prevents deformation and provides up to 200 cm3 of breathing space. This Product has no warranty</p>""

ALL SPECS
JBL seems to make a portable Bluetooth speaker for every budget and need, some of which are massive, but the Clip series has always been about being easy to take anywhere. The new $69.95 JBL Clip 4 has a built-in carabiner and a fully waterproof build. It’s meant for the great outdoors, and delivers solid sound without weighing you down. As you might expect, a speaker this size and price isn’t going to deliver a bass bonanza, nor does it pack a ton of extra features. But the Clip 4 gets the important stuff right, delivering crisp, rich audio from a waterproof enclosure, making it a solid, budget-friendly portable option.
A Go-Anywhere Design
Measuring 5.3 by 3.4 by 1.8 inches (HWD) and weighing in at roughly half a pound, the Clip 4 is available in nine color options—some patterned—including black, blue, camo, gray, pink, and red. The rounded front and back panels are covered in grille that protects a single 40mm, 5-watt driver. A built-in carabiner frames the top portion of the speaker, and a USB-C port is located at the bottom.

The front panel has a huge JBL logo rising from the grille, with buttons above it for play/pause and volume down/up. A double press of the play button skips forward a track, but there’s no backward track function, oddly. There’s a dedicated power button on the left side panel, as well as a Bluetooth pairing button. On the back panel, there are rubberized strips to keep the speaker stable when lying flat on desktops.</p>",,,,,,,
