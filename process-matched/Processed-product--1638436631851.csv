The JBL Clip 4�s ultra-portable design blends well with the latest styles, and its colorful fabrics and expressive details make it look as cool as it sounds.
With the redesigned JBL Clip 4 carabiner that is built into the loudspeaker itself for added protection, you can hook it up and explore the world.

ALL SPECS
JBL seems to make a portable Bluetooth speaker for every budget and need, some of which are massive, but the Clip series has always been about being easy to take anywhere. The new $69.95 JBL Clip 4 has a built-in carabiner and a fully waterproof build. It�s meant for the great outdoors, and delivers solid sound without weighing you down. As you might expect, a speaker this size and price isn�t going to deliver a bass bonanza, nor does it pack a ton of extra features. But the Clip 4 gets the important stuff right, delivering crisp, rich audio from a waterproof enclosure, making it a solid, budget-friendly portable option.
A Go-Anywhere Design
Measuring 5.3 by 3.4 by 1.8 inches (HWD) and weighing in at roughly half a pound, the Clip 4 is available in nine color options�some patterned�including black, blue, camo, gray, pink, and red. The rounded front and back panels are covered in grille that protects a single 40mm, 5-watt driver. A built-in carabiner frames the top portion of the speaker, and a USB-C port is located at the bottom.

The front panel has a huge JBL logo rising from the grille, with buttons above it for play/pause and volume down/up. A double press of the play button skips forward a track, but there�s no backward track function, oddly. There�s a dedicated power button on the left side panel, as well as a Bluetooth pairing button. On the back panel, there are rubberized strips to keep the speaker stable when lying flat on desktops.</p>","","","","","","",""
