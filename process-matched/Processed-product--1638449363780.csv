It is a thin sauce, with the consistency of soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce, which it looks like. It is a hydrolysed vegetable protein-based sauce used as a substitute for meat flavouring. The taste of soy sauce is predominated by saltiness, followed by moderate umami, sweet taste, and finally slight bitterness, which is hard to perceive due to the masking effect of other tastes.</p>","","","","","","",""
